      Hello, my name is
      %span Roman Rott!
    .text-block
      %p
        I'm a Ukrainian front-end/back-end developer with 10+ years of IT experience and 5 years experience dedicated to web development and security audit of web applications.
        I specialize in developing secure and optimised apps as well as in testing websites for security vulnerabilities.
      %p
        %strong Ruby
        is my favorite when it comes to following TDD and OOP best practices, while
        %strong JavaScript
        is the best one for front-end and functional programming.
      %p I do enjoy building everything from small OSS libs, business sites, landing pages to rich interactive web apps, single page applications, etc.
      %p
        I'm working remotely on web projects for clients all over the world and from time to time I take part in bug-bounty programs.

        %p Over the 9 years I was working on various positions and at different departments in a big Cloud and Shared Hosting company, Ecommerce.com. 6 of them were in Tech Support(Customer Relation) department and 4 in IT as a Ruby/Rails developer. There I grew up as a web-developer, as a manager, and as a person.

        %p Now I am an Engineer at Sphere Software, a consulting company, where I've got extended expirience in React, Redux and ES6.

        %p I also design and develop vulnerable applications for CTF hacking games that give an opportunity for researchers to practice their skills. Below is a portfolio that contains a list of such web services.

        %p
          All of these sites were developed using
          %strong
            Ruby, CoffeeScript, JS, ES6, React, Backbone, Sinatra, Padrino and RoR
          frameworks. Some of them handles large amounts of traffic on daily basis.

        %p My Full-Stack web developer portfolio is a brief summary of the projects samples that I've accomplished during last 2 years.
