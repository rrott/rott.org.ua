            Hello, my name is <strong>Roman Rott</strong>, and I am a <strong>Ruby/JS developer</strong> with a strong interest in <strong>Ethical Hacking</strong>, penetration testing and vulnerability analysis. I have 15 years of IT experience and 8 years experience dedicated to web-development and security auditing of web applications. My technical expertise also includes React, Redux, Svelte, a bit of Node.js and so on. I like testing websites against security vulnerabilities and getting a lot of fun refactoring and optimizing existing apps/libs/sites.
